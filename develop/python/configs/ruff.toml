# known-first-party is necessary because of the monorepo architecture.
# Ruff looks for first-party modules by first scanning the current directory (or a `src` directory in the current directory), then in the project root (the nearest 'pyproject.toml').
# So if you run the linter in the `apps/core` directory, for example, the eave modules are correctly classified as first-party, because the module path can be resolved from that directory.
# If, however, you run the linter in the root of the project, where there is no `src` directory and module path can't be resolved, then all of the eave modules are classified as third-party.
# It's possible to configure Ruff to look in specific places using the `src` configuration, but this is less messy.
