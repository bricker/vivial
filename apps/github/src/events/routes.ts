In shell scripting, comments are typically written using the hash symbol (#). However, multi-line comments are not directly supported. You can use multiple single-line comments instead. Here's how you can convert the given text to comments in shell:

# It is primarily responsible for setting up middleware to handle raw JSON data and 
# creating a router to process incoming POST requests. 
# The file plays a crucial role in enabling the application to receive and 
# correctly process incoming webhook events, particularly from GitHub.
```

/**
* This code file is primarily responsible for setting up and managing webhooks in an Express application.
* It exports two main functions: applyWebhookMiddlewares and WebhookRouter.
*
* The applyWebhookMiddlewares function is used to apply middleware to the Express application, specifically
* for handling raw JSON data. This is necessary for correctly processing GitHub signature verifications.
*
* The WebhookRouter function creates and returns a new Express Router. This router is configured to handle
* POST requests at its root path. Upon receiving a request, it dispatches the request and response objects
* to a separate function for further processing.
*
* Overall, this file is crucial for enabling the application to receive and correctly process incoming webhook events.
