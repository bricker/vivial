Hammer Museum,"Industrialist Armand Hammer founded this museum in 1990 primarily to house his own collection. But since then, it’s really come into its own as what I think is L.A.’s most exciting, forward-thinking art museum. With its decades-in-the-making master plan now fully realized, the free, UCLA partner institution stages fascinating shows of contemporary art, photography and design, often with an epmhasis on local artists (most notably with its “Made in L.A.” biennial). The shows are supplemented by a small permanent collection of the Impressionists and Old Masters, and the Hammer’s public events calendar (arguably one of the best in the city) is chock full of free lectures and screenings.","10899 Wilshire Blvd.

Hike: Bronson Canyon Trail in Griffith Park,"Length: Less than a mile roundtrip

Located in the southwest section of Griffith Park and easily accessible from Hollywood, Bronson Canyon has been a popular location for generations of filmmakers who make use of its remote-looking, somewhat alien setting. Bronson Canyon has been featured in classics like The Searchers and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, as well as more recent films like Star Trek VI and Army of Darkness. “Bronson Cave” is actually a 50-foot long tunnel, the remnants of a quarry that was founded in 1903 and originally called Brush Canyon. The tunnel entrance is best known as the mouth of the Batcave from the 1960s Batman TV series.","3200 Canyon Dr., Los Angeles, CA 90068","https://www.laparks.org/sites/default/files/facility/bronson-canyon/images/bronson-caves-17.jpg

Hike: Runyon Canyon Loop,"Length: About 3 miles roundtrip

This hike is by no means a wilderness experience, so if you’re looking for solitude, you might want to try other trails. On the other hand, this is a great hike for people-watching and possible celebrity sightings - it gives beginning hikers a chance to check out the Hollywood Hills and the amazing views at the trail summit, known as Cloud’s Rest.

Whether you’re wearing the latest hiking gear or just sneakers and sun hats, this is a fun hike highlighted by million-dollar mansions and priceless views of the Hollywood Sign, the Sunset Strip and the L.A.

Hike: Discovery Trail in Franklin Canyon Park,"Length: About 1 mile roundtrip

Located near Benedict Canyon at the geographical center of Los Angeles, Franklin Canyon Park spans 605 acres and features over five miles of hiking trails. The park’s history dates to 1914, when William Mulholland built the Upper Franklin Canyon Reservoir. In the 1930s, the family of oil baron Edward Doheny used the canyon as a summer retreat. The easy stroll around the reservoir offers plentiful views of birds and wildlife, as well as access to other, more difficult trails such as the Hastain Trail, which rises to offer views from West L.A. to the Pacific.

Pop culture fans will likely recognize Franklin Canyon Park, which is frequently used as a TV and film location, including the famous hitchhiking scene from It Happened One Night with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. The three-acre Franklin Lake was the “fishing hole” in the opening credits of The Andy Griffith Show, as well as the lagoon in the Universal Studios horror classic Creature from the Black Lagoon. The park was also the background for the cover photo of Simon & Garfunkel’s album Sounds of Silence.","2600 Franklin Canyon Dr, Beverly Hills, CA 90210","https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/sites/default/files/images/2019-01/180908_FranklinCanyon_007.jpg?width=1024&fit=bound&quality=72&auto=webp

Hike: Betty B. Dearing Trail at Wilacre Park,"Length: About 2.5 miles roundtrip

Because its parking lot entrance is located on Fryman Road, the 128-acre Wilacre Park is often mistakenly referred to as Fryman Canyon Park. In fact, this hike can take you through three parks: Wilacre, Fryman Canyon and Coldwater Canyon. The well-shaded, dog-friendly Betty B. Dearing Trail starts off steep before it begins to level off after a quarter mile. One mile into your hike and you’ll be at Coldwater Canyon Park, home of TreePeople, a leading environmental nonprofit organization. The cul-de-sac at Iredell Lane leads you to the hidden Rainforest Trail within Fryman Canyon.","3431 Fryman Rd, Studio City, CA 91604","https://www.laparks.org/sites/default/files/facility/wilacre-park/images/san-vicente-mountain-park-29.jpg

Hike: Eaton Canyon Trail,"Length: About 4 miles roundtrip

Open daily from sunrise to sunset, the Eaton Canyon Natural Area is a 190-acre zoological, botanical, and geological nature preserve situated at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. In addition to hiking, visitors can enjoy equestrian trails with a staging area, picnic areas, a seasonal stream, and native flora and fauna in their natural habitats. The Eaton Canyon Nature Center features a wonderful variety of live animals on display, fascinating exhibits and useful visitor information.

From the trailhead at the north end of the parking lot, hike along the well-marked main path of the Eaton Canyon Trail to the junction marked WATERFALL. Continue to the next junction and follow the trail under the concrete bridge and into Eaton Canyon. From here, the trail is less defined and much more rugged. There’s boulder-hopping and - depending on the season and rainfall - you could be creek-crossing, so be prepared. Continue through the main canyon and you’ll arrive at a 40-foot waterfall, an especially popular destination during the summer, thanks to its cooling mist and the small pool at its base.","1750 N Altadena Dr, Pasadena, CA 91107","https://media.timeout.com/images/105970555/1536/1152/image.webp

The Mistake Room,"Founded in 2014, TMR works with artists, thinkers, and makers from around the globe to commission new works and projects; develop and present research-driven exhibitions; facilitate the creation of ideas through discursive initiatives; and organize moments and events that enrich what we know about art and culture.

Our program happens in a renovated industrial warehouse space at the southernmost edge of Downtown LA as well as in other venues around the city and the world. This allows us to connect Los Angeles to peoples, places, and histories well beyond its confines.

To advance our work we devise innovative support structures that respond to the inequities that too often determine who gets to make culture and for who.  In challenging and expanding the function of the non-profit model we hope to boldly redefine what an independent art space can be.

Named after a performance that proposed mistakes as generative moments, we believe mistakes are ruptures of the status quo and that the discomforts we feel when we make them are but new ways of being and knowing. That is why we embrace what others deem unconventional and champion those who inspire us to think about art and culture in radical ways.","1811 E. 20th Street

MAK Center for Art and Architecture: Schindler House,"The MAK Center for Art and Architecture is a contemporary, experimental, multi-disciplinary center for art and architecture headquartered in three significant architectural works by the Austrian-American architect R.M. Schindler. Offering a year-round schedule of exhibitions and events, the MAK Center presents programming that challenges conventional notions of architectural space and relationships between the creative arts.

The Center is headquartered in the landmark Schindler House (R.M. Schindler, 1922) in West Hollywood; operates a residency program and exhibition space at the Mackey Apartments (R.M. Schindler, 1939) and runs more intimate programming at the Fitzpatrick-Leland House (R.M. Schindler, 1936) in Los Angeles. The MAK Center is the California satellite of the MAK – Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, and works in cooperation with the FOSH.

Unique in its role as a constellation of historic architectural sites and contemporary exhibition spaces, the MAK Center develops local, national, and international projects exploring the intersection of art and architecture. It seeks out and supports projects that test disciplinary boundaries. Acting as a cultural think tank for current issues, the MAK Center encourages exploration of practical and theoretical ideas in art and architecture by engaging the center’s places, spaces, and histories. Its programming includes exhibitions, lectures, symposia, discussions, performances, music series, publication projects, salons, architecture tours, and new work commissions. It collaborates frequently with guest curators, artists and architects.

The Schindler House, designed by modern architect and Viennese émigré Rudolph M. Schindler, is considered one of the world’s first modern houses. It has influenced and inspired generations of architects worldwide. It redefined notions of public and private, and indoor and outdoor space; and broke new ground in the design and construction of the modern dwelling. Schindler and his wife Pauline regularly hosted artists, musicians, poets, writers, and actors, and so their home quickly turned into a center for avant-garde art and inquiry. Today, the Schindler House is regarded as one of Los Angeles’s most beloved architectural and cultural landmarks. It is the MAK Center’s mission to preserve and promote Schindler’s architecture and continue his and Pauline’s legacy of artistic and cultural experimentation.","835 N. Kings Road
