## Webhook Event Handler

```
POST /
```

This API endpoint is used to handle webhook events. It authenticates the request, logs the event, and then processes the payload based on the type of webhook event. If the event is a "comment_created" event, it triggers the `commentCreatedEventHandler` function. If the event type is not handled, it logs a warning and sends a 200 status response.

### Path Parameters

None

### Example Request

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    webhookEvent: 'comment_created',
    // other necessary data
  }),
});
```

### Example Response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### Response Codes

**200**: The request was successful. This code is returned after the webhook event is processed, or if the event type is not handled.

**400**: The request was unsuccessful. This code is returned if there is an error during the processing of the "comment_created" event.
